How is the MICR data on U.S. check organized?
There are five major fields on a MICR line :
1. Auxiliary On Us - contains check number if present; bracketed by on us symbols
2. EPC - one character located to the left of the transit field if present
3. Transit - 9 digits including check digit
4. On Us - variable length 19 digits max; between transit and amount fields
5. Amount - 10 digits zero filled; bracketed by two amount symbols

Two of the five major fields are broken into multiple fields:
Transit (9 digits)
6. Routing Number (digits 1-4)
7. Bank Number (digits 5-8)
8. Check Digit (1 digit)
On Us
9. Account Number - Variable length; always followed by the On Us symbol
10. Check number - Located in various places in the on us field
11. TPC - max 6 characters; Located to right of account number
