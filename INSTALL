INSTALL
=======

Normal installation via cpan is not the best way to go unless you install the non perl dependencies first.

One of the most crucial things you will have to do is make up your mind where you want to store your
gocr micr databse in.. this is a collection of files to aid gocr in recognizing a MICR line.


inside ./micrdb is an optimized database for use with gocr.

This needs to be present somewhere on the host machine.

Suggested is a place such as /usr/share/micrdb

---

HOW TO INSTALL GOCR
===================

 rpm -Uvh ./gocr-0.40-1.i386.rpm

CHECK YOUR KERNEL FIRST
uname -a

dont install i386 on a 64bit etc machine!!!! 

---

REQUIREMENTS
============

gocr-0.40 or higher, included in this dist
ImageMagick
perl 5 or higher
Finance::MICR::LineParser 


---

After you have gocr installed..

Inside the directory of the package:

perl t/0_imager_formats_test_for_png.t
perl t/1_gocr.t
perl t/2_check.t

You can also test out the checkscan script

perl bin/checkscan -q ./t/checks_hard/hard1.png

perl bin/checkscan -q -i 2 -x 10 ./t/checks_hard/hard1.png
